Hi,

I hope this mail finds you well. I am delighted to invite you to attend my upcoming PhD thesis defense. The details of the event are attached at the bottom this mail. 

The defense, which is open to the public, presents an opportunity for me to share the culmination of my research journey. As a valued guest and supporter of my academic and/or personal journey, I would appreciate your presence (in-person or virtually). 

Here is a brief outline of the schedule:
- Presentation with light refreshments (45 min)
- Question-answer session with the audience (30 min)
- Closed question-answer session with the oral exam committee (30 min)

The details of the event are as follows:

*High-Integrity Urban Localization: Bringing Safety in Aviation to Autonomous Driving*

Advisor: Grace Gao

**Date: Friday, May 26, 2023**

**Time: 2:00 pm**

**Location: Y2E2 299** 

**Zoom Link: [https://stanford.zoom.us/j/98405817616](https://stanford.zoom.us/j/98405817616?pwd=NFFWYjhNWUR2OWdsck5iUlNuWGRmUT09)** 

Aviation stands as one of the safest sectors in transportation systems. By building on proven techniques from aviation, collectively termed as integrity monitoring, we address the challenges of achieving accurate and reliable localization in dynamic urban environments. Integrating these techniques into the localization pipeline allows us to mitigate measurement faults, estimate error bounds, and significantly enhance the reliability of the localization system. The presented techniques establish a robust foundation for autonomous vehicles to navigate urban settings with enhanced safety.</p>


Please let me know if you have any questions. I hope to see you soon!

Cheers,
Shubh
