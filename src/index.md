# Bio

I am a PhD candidate at Stanford University working with Professor [Grace Gao](https://aa.stanford.edu/people/grace-gao) on developing safe and reliable systems for autonomous navigation. My research focuses on multi-sensor state estimation, perception, and uncertainty quantification, with a particular emphasis on addressing the challenges faced by the autonomous vehicle industry. I have previously been the only TA of the courses AA272C: GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEMS in Winter 2020 and AA275: NAVIGATION AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS in Fall 2020 and Fall 2021.

Prior to attending Stanford, I was a graduate student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the GPS Lab, where I worked on robust localization algorithms using GPS measurements. 

Prior to attending UIUC, I was a student at IIT Kanpur where I earned a Bachelors of Technology in Electrical Engineering and a minor in Computer Architecture. I co-led the student team for participating in the [Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition](http://www.igvc.org) in 2017 and was a member of the student team for participating in [ABU Robocon](https://www.aburobocon2023.com) in 2015 and 2016.
